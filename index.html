                            You repay 6% of everything earned above £21,000 – earn less and you don't repay. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you're eligible to start repaying, you will only actually repay if you're earning above £1,750 a month or £404 per week – equivalent to £21,000 a year.  In Scotland, you need to be earning over £25,000 a year, and in Northern Ireland, it's just £19,895 a year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The amount you repay for postgraduate loans is 6% (9% in Scotland and Northern Ireland) of everything above that, this is lower than undergraduate loans which are set at 9% above the threshold. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even if you've started repaying the loan in a year, but then lose your job or take a pay cut, your repayments drop accordingly. Of course if you never earn over £21,000 that means you'd never need to repay a penny. <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/postgraduate-loans/">https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/postgraduate-loans/</a>

                                    Use any pension contribution method (relief at source, net pay, salary sacrifice) to contribution to your employer or personal pension. Note that any pension contributions using the relief at source scheme (for example, where you make contributions to a SIPP) will require you to claim the additional 20% tax relief (the pension provider will automatically make a 25% top-up to any contributions) from the higher rate tax band. You can either submit a self-assessment or contact HMRC via phone, chat or writing to request an amendment of your personal allowance to reclaim the tax.
                                </li>

You can choose to either receive child benefit and pay the charge at the end of the tax year, or not get child benefit and pay nothing. The reason you may want to consider claiming and paying is to ensure you or your spouse can claim NI credit without working. You can also claim NI credits by opting out of the benefit and filling out the claim form appropriaately.

                            You can the same methods as higher rate tax payers to avoid tax at this point. You also do not lose any additional benefits.

                            Calculating whether your income reaches this threshold becomes slightly more complicated as you can no longer claim a reduced threshold from salary sacrifice, but must include this in your adjusted gross income calculations. The relevant calculations for the threshold and adjust income can be found at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pension-schemes-work-out-your-tapered-annual-allowance">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pension-schemes-work-out-your-tapered-annual-allowance</a>.

                            For every &#163;2 that your 'adjusted income' goes over &#163;240,000 your annual allowance will decrease linearly till it reaches &#163;4,000 when your 'adjust income' is &#163;312,000.
