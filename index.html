                                <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You are part of the tax system, but do not currently need to pay any tax or national insurance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a PAYE employee you will now have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-codes">tax code</a>. Tax codes are used by your employer to calculate the amount of tax that should be deducted from your wages or pension before they hit your bank account.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Remember:</strong> Each income you have (jobs, private pensions) will have different tax codes. Remember to check them all!

                                        Transfer up to &#163;1,260 of your spouse's personal allowance to yourself (assuming they are also a basic rate tax payer) using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/marriage-allowance">marriage allowance</a>

                                You are now a higher rate tax payer and your marginal tax rate is now 40%. You will pay income tax at 40% on everything above the higher rate threshold, but will continue to pay 20% tax on the basic rate band and continue to receive a personal allowance.
                            </p>

                                You can use a variety of methods to avoid paying tax at this point (up to the additional rate band):
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Use any pension contribution method (relief at source, net pay, salary sacrifice) to contribution to your employer or personal pension. Note that any pension contributions using the relief at source scheme (for example, where you make contributions to a SIPP) will require you to claim the additional 20% tax relief (the pension provider will automatically make a 25% top-up to any contributions) from the higher rate tax band. You can either submit a self-assessment or contact HMRC via phone, chat or writing to request an amendment of your personal allowance to reclaim the tax.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Use salary sacrifice to make purchases through your employer, for example: additional PTO days and the <a href="https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk">cycle to work scheme</a> to effectively lower your salary
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Use venture capital schemes (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-apply-for-the-enterprise-investment-scheme">EIS</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-apply-to-use-the-seed-enterprise-investment-scheme">SEIS</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-apply-to-use-social-investment-tax-relief">SITR</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-tax-relief-for-investors">VCT</a>) to claim 30% or 50% of your investments against your income tax
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                        You or your spouse pay the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge">high income child benefit charge</a> if you are claiming child benefit. You can choose to either receive child benefit and pay the charge at the end of the tax year, or not get child benefit and pay nothing. The reason you may want to consider claiming and paying is to ensure you or your spouse can claim NI credit without working. You can also claim NI credits by opting out of the benefit and filling out the claim form appropriately.
